# Overview

This networking project was designed to connect virtually an unlimited amount of pcs together and display your character for other pcs to see!

I wrote a networking program that utilizes multithreading and TCP to connect pcs together and displays their x and y coordinates by using the pygame module in python!

I really love making videogames, so I wanted to take things to the next level and make a LAN game that you can play with your friends!
